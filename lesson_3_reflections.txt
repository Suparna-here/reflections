When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my work with others or want to work with others in a colaborative way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That is because I may be working on those files, already done few commits and right now doing more changes which are not commited yet. 
Being Author of the files I can decide when those are ready to collaborate with others through pull. Otherwise it can lead to unintended changes 
in local code base or lead to conflicts, which I will not be able to resolve effectively as I am middle of something and yet to commit.
