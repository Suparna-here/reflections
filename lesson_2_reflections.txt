What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
By running git init, .git folder is created in the directory. OFF
$git log  
current branch master, no commit.

$git status
no commit yet. with untracked files. Run "git add <file>..." to include what will be commited.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

$git add <file>
add file to Staging area.
Makes the stage what to commit next. Make it possible to have 1commit per logical change.
